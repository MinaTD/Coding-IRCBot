Hi ! And welcome to this basic IRC Bot generator.

As you will go through the following steps, you will have instructions on how to handle this OOP software.

1 - First go to "http://webchat.freenode.net/" webpage.

2 - Then identify yourself by using a Nickname, anything will do the job ;). Don't forget to fill in the Channels input with the name of the channel you want to join.

2 - Once you are connected, you will be logged into the desired discussion.

3 - Now, through your terminal, go to the folder containing the software and execute the following file: Bot.py

N.B. :By default, the channel is "##RoiLion" but feel free to adapt the variables of the file 'Bot.py' to suit your needs.

Extra information:
Beside the OOP folder you have an irc.py file build thanks to the source below.

This project was realised in the context of a formation to programming language delivered by the Coding Academy - Epitech.
